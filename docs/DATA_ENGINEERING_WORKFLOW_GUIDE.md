# 🧠 Data Engineering Workflow

This is basically your **step-by-step game plan** for handling data like a pro — from testing tiny samples to catching when your data starts acting weird.

## ⚡️ The Big Picture

Here's the overall flow of how your data journey should go:

```
1. Prototype → 2. Validate → 3. Version → 4. Register → 5. Log → 6. Monitor → 7. Detect Drift
```

Basically:

* Start small
* Check if it's clean
* Save versions
* Make it findable
* Keep track of it
* Watch for problems
* Spot weird changes

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### **Step 1: Prototype (Play with a sample)**

**Script:** `src/prototype_etl_sampling.py`

You're just testing your ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) logic with a *tiny piece* of your data so you can make mistakes fast and fix them easy.

* Uses only 1% of your big data.
* Lets you test how you clean, filter, and tweak features.
* Runs quick so you're not waiting forever.

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/prototype_etl_sampling.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Keep tweaking until your transformations look right. Then move on to the full dataset.

### **Step 2: Validate (Make sure your data ain't busted)**

**Script:** `src/validate_data_schema.py`

Now that your ETL logic works, check that your data actually *fits* what you expect — types, ranges, etc.

* Uses Pandera to define the "rules" your data should follow.
* Fails gracefully if something's off.

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/validate_data_schema.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Always run validation before you process anything serious. If data breaks rules, stop the pipeline.

### **Step 3: Version (Keep receipts)**

**Script:** `src/version_data_with_dvc.sh`

Once your data is clean and verified, save a *version* of it. That way, if something goes wrong later, you can rewind time like a data wizard.

* Uses DVC (Data Version Control).
* Tracks your datasets like Git tracks your code.

**Run it:**

```bash
bash src/version_data_with_dvc.sh
```

💡 *Tip:* Tag versions (like `v1.0-training-set`) so you know what data went with which model.

### **Step 4: Register (Make it discoverable)**

**Script:** `src/register_data_catalog.py`

Now that your dataset's official, register it so your team knows it exists and what it's about.

* Adds dataset info (name, path, description) to a catalog file (`data_catalog.jsonl`).

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/register_data_catalog.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Add tags and clear descriptions — future you (and your coworkers) will thank you.

### **Step 5: Log (Keep track of the glow-up)**

**Script:** `src/log_data_lineage.py`

Track *where* your data came from and *what's been done* to it. Think of it as a "data diary."

* Logs metadata like source, timestamps, columns, etc.
* Writes to `metadata_log.jsonl`.

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/log_data_lineage.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Log every major step — ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering — so you can trace things later.

### **Step 6: Monitor (Check it's still fresh)**

**Script:** `src/check_data_freshness.py`

You don't wanna train on crusty, outdated data. This script makes sure your data isn't stale.

* Checks if your dataset is older than a set number of hours.
* Warns you if it's too old.

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/check_data_freshness.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Use this before training or inference. Adjust how strict the "freshness" check is depending on your setup.

### **Step 7: Detect Drift (Spot weird behavior)**

**Script:** `src/detect_feature_drift.py`

Sometimes your data changes subtly over time — this "drift" can mess up your ML models. This script checks for that.

* Compares old vs. new data.
* Uses stats tests to see if features have shifted.

**Run it:**

```bash
python src/detect_feature_drift.py
```

💡 *Tip:* Run this weekly or before retraining your model. If drift shows up — time to retrain or debug.

## 🚀 Full Workflow Example

Here's the whole thing, start to finish:

```bash
python src/prototype_etl_sampling.py
python src/validate_data_schema.py
bash src/version_data_with_dvc.sh
python src/register_data_catalog.py
python src/log_data_lineage.py
python src/check_data_freshness.py
python src/detect_feature_drift.py
```

## 💎 Core Principles

### **When you're just building stuff (Dev stage):**

* Prototype fast 🔁
* Validate early ✅
* Version everything 🧾

### **When deploying (Team-ready):**

* Register datasets 🗂️
* Track lineage 🧭

### **When in production (Keep it alive):**

* Monitor freshness ⏰
* Detect drift 🧠

## 🧰 You'll Need

Install these packages:

```bash
uv add pandas pandera scipy dvc
# or
uv sync
```

## 🏭 For Real Production Stuff

Once you level up from the "learning" phase:

* Use **Airflow**, **Prefect**, or **Dagster** to automate things
* Use **Grafana**, **DataDog**, or **CloudWatch** for alerts
* Store metadata in a real **database**
* Use proper **catalog tools** (DataHub, AWS Glue, etc.)
* Add **tests** for each script

## 🧃 TL;DR Summary

Good data engineering = good habits:

1. Prototype fast
2. Validate always
3. Version everything
4. Register datasets
5. Track lineage
6. Monitor freshness
7. Detect drift

This follows the principle of "shift left" in data engineering—catching issues as early as possible in the workflow to prevent costly failures downstream.

Follow this workflow, and your ML pipeline will thank you at 3 AM.
